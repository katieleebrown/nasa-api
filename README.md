# NASA Daily
This is a quick one-page app built with React that uses NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day API to display a new photo daily. You can check out NASA's API list <a href="https://api.nasa.gov/">here.</a>

# How It's Made
Tech Used: React, Javascript, APIs, CSS & HTML

This app was spun up with Vite to make a quick and simple React app with APIs and a light/dark mode toggle. 

# Optimizations
NASA has a huge list of APIs that are available to the public, including photos, videos, sounds, and insight straight from astronauts and NASA scientists. My hope is that this page grows to include a variety of these APIs in one easy to access place. Check back soon to see some new additions!
